# Rock or Mine Classification System Using Machine Learning

Developed a Python-based system to predict whether an object is a Rock or Mine using Sonar signal data. Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Bagging, and Random Forest models comparing performance with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Analyzed model efficiency and accuracy across scenarios.
